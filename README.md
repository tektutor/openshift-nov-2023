## Docker Overview
- Application Virtualization Technology
- each container represents one running application
- in other words, each container is an application process
- containers don't get their own dedicated hardware resources
- containers are not OS
- containers will never be able to replace Virtual Machine or Operating System
- Certain features of Containers appears similar to an Operating System
- Just like Virtual Machines get an IP address, even container get their own IP address
- Just like Virtual machines has it own file system, even container has its file sytem
- Virtual Machine with Linux distributions has its own package managers to install/uninstall/update/upgrade softwares, same way container also has its own package managers
- Unlike Virtual machines, the containers runs only one single application wherease VMs are fully functional Operating System hence many applications can run in the operating system installed within Virtual Machine.
